# Find-Nearest-Public-Library
Introduction:
In today's fast-paced digital world, people often forget the importance of public libraries. However, they remain a valuable resource for knowledge seekers, students, and anyone looking to expand their reading horizons. To bridge the gap between the digital world and public libraries, we propose the "Georgia Library Finder & Book Recommender." This web application will allow users to quickly find public libraries in Georgia based on their zip code and receive book recommendations based on their preferred genre.

Overview:

The Georgia Library Finder & Book Recommender is a web application that helps users to locate public libraries in Georgia and get book recommendations. The application has two main features: library finder and book recommender. The library finder feature allows users to input their zip code and get a list of public libraries in their area, along with their name, address, and hours of operation. The book recommender feature allows users to select their preferred genre and receive a book recommendation along with its availability at the user's local library.

General Roadmap:

Collect and clean data: The application will use a zip code database, county library data, and a book database to provide accurate and up-to-date information on public libraries and book recommendations.
Develop a user interface: The application will have a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to input their zip code and select their preferred book genre from a list of genres.
Implement the library finder feature: The application will use the Georgia Public Library Service's PINES catalog to find local libraries and display their name, address, and hours of operation.
Implement the book recommender feature: The application will use a list of popular book genres and their associated keywords to search the Georgia PINES catalog for books that match the user's selected genre. The application will sort the results by popularity and randomly select a book from the top 20 results. Users will be able to view a brief synopsis and reviews of the recommended book, and can check its availability at their local Georgia library by clicking on a link.
Test and deploy: The application will be tested rigorously to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Once testing is complete, the application will be deployed to a web server for public use.
Note: The genres list will be created manually and will include a set of popular genres such as mystery, romance, thriller, etc.

The backend will be developed using Python and Flask to handle data processing and communication with the database. The book recommendation feature will use a combination of web scraping and data analysis to suggest books based on the user's selected genre. The application will be deployed on a web server using cloud technologies such as AWS or Google Cloud.

Framework:

The Georgia Library Finder & Book Recommender will be developed using a combination of frontend and backend technologies. The frontend will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and responsive user interface. The backend will be developed using Python and Flask to handle data processing and communication with the database. The book recommendation feature will use a machine learning algorithm to suggest books based on the user's preferred genre. The application will be deployed on a web server using cloud technologies such as AWS or Google Cloud.
